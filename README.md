## Project Overview

This portfolio website is a personal project created by me to display my skills and projects as a frontend developer. It serves as an online resume and a platform to showcase my work to potential employers and collaborators.

The website consists of the following sections:

1. **Navigation Bar**: A fixed navigation bar at the top of the page allows users to quickly jump to different sections of the site.

2. **Welcome Section**: This section introduces me with a greeting and a brief description of my role as a frontend developer.

3. **Projects**: The projects section displays a collection of project tiles, each representing one of my projects. Each tile includes an image, project name, and a link.

4. **Contact**: In this section, users are encouraged to connect with me. A playful question adds a personal touch, and various social media links and contact options are provided.

5. **Footer**: The footer contains a copyright notice with my name and the year the portfolio was created.
